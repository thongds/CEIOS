1
00:00:10,914 --> 00:00:19,760
You want all my love and my devotion

2
00:00:20,256 --> 00:00:31,317
You want my loving soul right on the line

3
00:00:31,517 --> 00:00:40,000
I have no doubt that I could love you forever

4
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:49,660
The only trouble is you really don't have the time

5
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:59,390
You've got one night only, one night only, that's all you have to spare

6
00:01:00,287 --> 00:01:09,620
One night only, let's not pretend to care

7
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:19,460
One night only, one night only, come on big baby come on

8
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:29,820
One night only, we only have til dawn

9
00:01:29,864 --> 00:01:35,240
In the morning this feeling will be gone

10
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,490
It has no chance going on

11
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:46,990
Something so right has got no chance to live

12
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:55,800
So let's forget about chances, its one night I will give

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,966
One night only, one night only,you'll be the only one

14
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:12,830
One night only then you have to run

15
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:21,740
one night only, one night only.

16
00:02:21,955 --> 00:02:23,955
there's nothing more to say

17
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:32,410
one night only, what's getting in the way

18
00:02:36,622 --> 00:02:51,710
one night only, one night only,one night only

19
00:02:54,214 --> 00:02:56,214
end
